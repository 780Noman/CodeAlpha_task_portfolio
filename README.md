## *Noman Amjad* | Data Scientist & AI Engineer

**üëã About Me**:

I am a results-driven AI Engineer and Data Scientist, having graduated with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and a **topper of my batch with a CGPA of 3.96**. With approximately one year of combined professional experience through impactful internships, my expertise covers the entire project lifecycle: from in-depth **exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical feature engineering to building and fine-tuning complex deep learning models**. I specialize in creating robust, end-to-end applications that solve real-world challenges in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and predictive analytics.

üéì I recently completed a Research Internship in AI & Robotics at the prestigious NISAR Laboratory, KUAS, Japan, and an AI Developer Internship at Octaloop Technologies, where I honed my skills in model training, performance tuning, and software optimization.

üå± I have a strong interest in MLOps, using tools like DVC for data versioning to create reproducible and scalable machine learning pipelines.

üöÄ I excel at deploying models as interactive web applications using Streamlit, Django, and Flask,Gradio transforming complex data science projects into accessible tools.

üí¨ Ask me about NLP [Chatbot,Voice Assistant,Transformer architectures (BERT, T5)], Computer Vision [object detection Classification (YOLOv8,RCNN,VGG16,ResNet50v2),OpenCV], ML and DS [Many ML models and End-to-end ML pipeline  credit risk modeling,building AutoML platforms,Feedback system analysis]
